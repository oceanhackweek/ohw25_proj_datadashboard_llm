**Repo Structure**

* `contributor_folders` temp folder fors individual work
* `final_notebooks` marimo notebook to access dashboard
* `scripts` backend python scripts to control data access, tools available to the model, etc
* `data` data will all be cloud accessed. Will add links to cloud buckets once we have decided on which dataset we want to incorporate

## Data Dashboard powered by LLM:

### Planning
This reppository hold all code needed to run our LLM-powered climate data analysis dashboard. The project is in its early stages but will consistent of an app interface (containing interactive map, text box, and model output return) as well as a backend for LLM-driven data loading, visualization, and analysis.
