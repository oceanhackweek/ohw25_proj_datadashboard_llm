# ohw25_proj_datadashboard_llm

**Repo Structure**

* `contributor_folders` temp folder fors individual work

* `final_notebooks`:  
  - `marimo_notebook` notebook to access dashboard  
  - `llm_working_tutorial` to show the working flow of LLM  
  - `demo` example/demo notebooks  

* `scripts` backend python scripts to control data access, tools available to the model, etc
* `data` data will all be cloud accessed. Will add links to cloud buckets once we have decided on which dataset we want to incorporate

## Data Dashboard powered by LLM:

### Planning
This reppository hold all code needed to run our LLM-powered climate data analysis dashboard. The project is in its early stages but will consistent of an app interface (containing interactive map, text box, and model output return) as well as a backend for LLM-driven data loading, visualization, and analysis.

## Background
Boris has some chatbot experience... the rest of us are comfortable with python and excited to learn 

## Goals
Have a functioning interactive dashbord

## Datasets
can be found here:  [datasets](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw25_proj_datadashboard_llm/blob/main/data/dataset_track.ipynb)

## Workflow/Roadmap
Build UI, connect llm to one data set for initial testing, extend as far as we can 

## Results/Findings
In the works...

## Lessons Learned
Lots of moving parts in this project! Difficult to track keep track of/connect components. Marimo was hyped... but proved difficult. We are not about it. Keep your API keys hidden and protect your pennies.
